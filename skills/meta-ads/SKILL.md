name: meta-ads
description: Pull, analyze, and manage Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, Click-to-WhatsApp) ad performance via the Meta Marketing API. Use when the user mentions Meta ads, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, FB ads, IG ads, Ads Manager, ROAS, CPA, CPM, CTR, ad spend, campaign or ad set performance, creative fatigue, ad frequency, CTWA, audience or placement breakdowns, or wants to pause an ad, change a budget, or duplicate a winning ad. Trigger for Hebrew terms like פרסום בפייסבוק, פרסום באינסטגרם, פרסומות מטא, ביצועי קמפיין, פרסומות. Trigger on questions like how are my ads doing this week, which creative is winning, is my ad fatigued, what's my CPA, drop me a 30-day report. Trigger even if auth isn't set up — the skill walks through one-time setup. Do NOT use for organic Instagram analytics, Reels view counts on non-promoted posts, or organic Threads engagement; those need the Instagram Graph API.

# Meta Ads (Marketing API)

Pull ad performance data from Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Click-to-WhatsApp, Threads), run analyses, and — with explicit confirmation — write changes back (pause, budget, duplicate).

## When to consult this skill

Any question about Meta ad performance, creative health, audience/placement mix, or campaign management. If the user asks "how are my ads doing" without specifying a platform, ask whether they mean Meta or Google before defaulting.

## Three things to internalize before touching any script

**1. Where the scripts run matters.** The scripts call `graph.facebook.com` over the open internet. Some execution environments (including Claude's Linux sandbox in certain configurations) block this endpoint via proxy. If you hit a `ProxyError` / `Tunnel connection failed: 403` on the first call, run the scripts from the **user's host machine** — macOS, Windows, or Linux — using that machine's Python. Per-OS commands:
- **macOS:** `python3 scripts/auth_check.py`, deps via `python3 -m pip install --user requests`
- **Windows:** `python scripts/auth_check.py` (or `py scripts/auth_check.py` if `python` isn't on PATH), deps via `python -m pip install --user requests`
- **Linux:** `python3 scripts/auth_check.py`, deps via `python3 -m pip install --user requests` (add `--break-system-packages` on Debian/Ubuntu 22+)

The scripts themselves are pure Python with one dependency (`requests`) and no shell/OS assumptions, so they run identically everywhere once dependencies are installed.

**2. WhatsApp is not a separate ad surface.** Click-to-WhatsApp ads run on Facebook and Instagram placements. They show up in the Marketing API as regular ads with `destination_type=WHATSAPP` and conversion events under `actions` (look for `onsite_conversion.messaging_conversation_started_7d` and similar). Don't promise the user a "WhatsApp ads dashboard" — there isn't one.

**3. Read is safe, write is not.** Insights endpoints (GET) are idempotent and harmless. Pause / budget / duplicate (POST) actions touch real money. The write rules in `references/write-actions.md` are non-negotiable — read that file before any write call.

## The 37-month data wall

Meta's insights API only serves data from the last **37 months**. Any campaign older than that returns error `3018` and is effectively invisible. If the user asks "what was my best campaign ever" and their activity predates the window, the answer is "the API can't tell you — check Ads Manager's archived reports UI." Surface this before starting a query that's going to fail.

## Before anything else: check setup + discover accounts

The first three calls are always the same:

1. `python scripts/auth_check.py` — is the token alive, what identity does it resolve to, how many ad accounts does it see?
2. `python scripts/list_accounts.py --with-recent-spend` — which accounts are actually running ads right now? (Sorted by last-30-day spend, then lifetime spend.) This tells you which account to pin as `META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID`.
3. `python scripts/list_campaigns.py` — once you have the right account, what campaigns are on it?

If any of these fail, stop and walk the user through `references/setup.md`. Don't try to be clever and guess credentials.

### How to guide a user through setup (first-timers)

`references/setup.md` is written as a click-by-click walkthrough. When a user has no credentials yet:

1. **One step at a time.** Don't dump the whole document. Ask them which OS they're on, then give them the prerequisites block for that OS. Wait for them to report "done" before moving on.
2. **Confirm the path choice.** Walk through the Step 0 decision questions with them in chat. Don't assume — especially "do you boost from Instagram?" is easy to misjudge.
3. **Read back what they paste.** When they share a token, App ID, or ad account ID, echo it back (redact tokens to the first 8 chars) and confirm you have it right before you move on. This catches the #1 setup bug: pasting the System User's ID where the Ad Account ID should go.
4. **Verify before moving on.** After they fill in `.env`, run `auth_check.py` immediately. Don't let them run analysis commands until the verification returns `ok: true` — every "the report is empty" issue traces back to a half-broken `.env`.
5. **Match their OS in every command.** If they said "I'm on Windows," don't tell them to run `python3` — tell them `python` or `py`. If they said "Mac", use `python3`. The setup.md has per-OS blocks; copy the matching one into chat.

Required env vars (user provides these once during setup):
- `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` — either a long-lived user token (Path B, 60 days) or System User token (Path A, never expires). See the decision tree below.
- `META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID` — default ad account, format `act_1234567890` (scripts accept `--account-id` to override per call).
- `META_API_VERSION` — defaults to `v25.0` (current as of early 2026; v26.0 expected ~Sep 2026).

The user puts these in a `.env` file at the working directory or exports them in the shell. Scripts auto-load `.env` if present. See `assets/env.template`.

## Path A vs Path B: which token type?

This is the single most common failure mode. Get it right up front.

**Use Path A (System User token) when:**
- Ads run inside a Meta Business Manager you control.
- The ad accounts you want to analyze are owned by that BM.
- You want a token that never expires.

**Use Path B (long-lived user token) when:**
- You boost posts from the Instagram app (these often create a personal ad account outside any BM — invisible to System User tokens no matter what permissions you grant).
- Your ad account is attached to your personal Facebook profile, not a BM.
- You want to see every ad account your personal FB login can access (typically the broadest view).

**Can't tell which?** Start with Path B. It sees a strict superset of what Path A sees. Once you've identified the important accounts, you can optionally move them into a BM and switch to Path A for permanence.

Full setup steps for both paths: `references/setup.md`.

## Workflow: read operations

For any read request, follow this loop:

1. **Pick the right script.** Don't reinvent. The bundled scripts cover the common cases:
   - `auth_check.py` — verify token, list visible accounts briefly
   - `list_accounts.py` — discover all ad accounts, decode status, show lifetime + optional recent spend
   - `list_campaigns.py` — campaigns under an account, with status filters
   - `fetch_insights.py` — the workhorse. Date ranges, breakdowns (publisher_platform, age, gender, country, placement, device_platform), level (account/campaign/adset/ad), custom field lists. Read its `--help` before calling.
   - `creative_fatigue.py` — frequency + CTR decay analysis at the ad level
   - `anomaly_detect.py` — compares a date range against the prior equivalent range, flags significant changes
   - `exchange_token.py` — Path B only: swap short-lived user token for 60-day long-lived token

2. **Run it, capture JSON output.** Every script outputs structured JSON to stdout. Don't try to parse human-readable text — there isn't any. Pipe to a file if the user wants to keep the raw data: `python scripts/fetch_insights.py ... > insights.json`.

3. **Analyze with the playbooks.** Once you have the data, consult `references/analysis-playbooks.md` for the relevant pattern (fatigue, funnel, audience mix, anomalies). The playbook tells you what thresholds matter and what to recommend.

4. **Present in the user's preferred language.** If the user writes in Hebrew, respond in Hebrew. Keep metric names in English (`CTR`, `CPA`, `ROAS`) so they cross-reference cleanly with Ads Manager. If asked for a doc/dashboard, follow whatever design system skill they've set up.

## Workflow: write operations (pause, budget, duplicate)

These are the dangerous ones. Follow this protocol every time, no shortcuts:

1. **Surface the action and the impact in plain language before calling.** Example: "Pause ad `Campaign_v3` (ID 120214...). This ad spent ₪47 in the last 7 days with 0.8% CTR. Confirm?"
2. **Wait for explicit `yes` / `confirm` / the user's language equivalent in chat.** A previous "go ahead" in the conversation does not carry over. Each write needs its own confirmation.
3. **One action at a time by default.** If the user wants to bulk-pause 12 ads, present a numbered list and confirm the whole batch in one explicit message ("pause all 12") — but log each call separately.
4. **Always do a dry-run first when the script supports it** (`--dry-run` flag prints what would change without calling the API).
5. **Never auto-shift budgets above +50% in one call.** If the user wants a 3x increase, do it in steps with confirmation each time. Meta's learning phase resets on big budget changes anyway.

Full rules and edge cases in `references/write-actions.md`. Read it before calling any of: `pause_ad.py`, `update_budget.py`, `duplicate_ad.py`.

## Gotchas the scripts already handle for you

- **Currency minor units.** `amount_spent`, `balance`, `spend_cap`, `daily_budget`, `lifetime_budget` are returned by Meta as strings of minor units (agorot/cents/pence). `list_accounts.py` and `list_campaigns.py` convert these to major units in a `_major` or plain decimal field. Zero-decimal currencies (JPY, KRW, VND, ISK, TWD, etc.) are not divided.
- **Account status codes.** Scripts decode 1→ACTIVE, 2→DISABLED, 3→UNSETTLED, 7→PENDING_RISK_REVIEW, etc.
- **Pagination.** All scripts auto-paginate via `meta_client.paginate()`.
- **Rate limits.** `meta_client._request()` backs off on subcodes 1487742 / 2446079 / 1487390 and retries.
- **Async insights.** `fetch_insights.py` auto-falls-back to async jobs when sync queries would time out (or you can force with `--async`).
- **DELETED campaigns.** Meta's campaigns endpoint returns error 1815001 when you request DELETED. The script's `--status` choices deliberately exclude DELETED. To see deleted campaigns, use Ads Manager UI.

## What the bundled scripts don't handle

- Initial auth / token generation (manual, see `references/setup.md`).
- Pixel / Conversions API event ingestion (separate API).
- Ad creative upload.
- Audience creation.

If the user needs something the scripts don't cover, write a new one in the working directory using `scripts/meta_client.py` as the base — don't modify the bundled scripts.

## Reference files

Read these on demand, not all upfront.

- `references/setup.md` — One-time setup: decision tree Path A vs Path B, how to create the app, get tokens, find account IDs. Read this when the user has no credentials, or when `auth_check.py` fails.
- `references/insights-fields.md` — Field glossary, breakdown options, common metric definitions, gotchas (attribution windows, action_attribution, deduplication). Read this when constructing a custom insights query.
- `references/analysis-playbooks.md` — Patterns for creative fatigue, audience analysis, funnel diagnosis, anomaly response. Read this when the user asks for analysis, not just data.
- `references/write-actions.md` — Mandatory before any write call. Confirmation flow, safety thresholds, rollback patterns.
- `references/troubleshooting.md` — Common failure modes (sandbox proxy, IG boost invisible to SU tokens, missing requests module, encoding issues, 37-month cap, etc.). Read this when any script returns `ok: false` or something unexpected.

## Scaling beyond personal use

This skill is built for one user, one set of credentials, a handful of ad accounts. Multi-tenant / client-agency use (one operator managing dozens of client BMs) is a different build:
- Per-client credential storage (not everyone's tokens in one .env).
- Each client issues their own System User token from their own BM.
- Audit log of every write action, who triggered it, against which account.

Don't try to retrofit the personal skill for multi-tenant use. Tell the user it's a different build.
